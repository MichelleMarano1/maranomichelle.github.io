<div class="SecondFirst"> Hi there I'm Michelle! I have a Bachelor of Design and Indigenous Studies, I got a job working as a UX/UI designer...very quickly realized it was terrible and I made a grave mistake. I packed up from Toronto and moved back home to bancroft where I got a job as a receptionist at a mineral tour place. From here I moved up and became a field geologist assistant which I did for 2 seasonal years. This experience along with my Indigenous studies education I got a student contract with the MNRF which turned into a seasonal contract collecting cultural heritage data. Now I am in this course working my butt off and having a much better time than living in Toronto. </div>
